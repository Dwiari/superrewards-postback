**SuperRewards.com App Postback Handling Scripts for Publishers.**

Configure and drop one of these scripts onto your web server to handle information to you from SuperRewards. Choose a version which best suits your needs and customize as needed.

Each time a user has completed an Offer or Direct Payment for your App we will send your server a Postback. This Postback includes all of the information you need to award in-game currency to your user. These scripts will handle this Postback for you, and store the information in your database. 

The script you choose will need to be placed on a web server accessible from the Internet. (Ex: http://www.example.com/app/postback.php)

For more details, see our documentation at: http://docs.superrewards.com/v1.0/docs/getting-started
